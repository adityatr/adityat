On my first two trips, I went on behalf of Paytm Canada, to develop the PayPay app. PayPay\u0026rsquo;s engineering team had humble beginnings - we worked in one of the smaller offices at a WeWork in Ginza,Tokyo. PayPay started with an idea to reduce cash usage in Japan, a country where cash is still a dominant force, making up to 64% of all transactions. During my recent vacation, I witnessed first hand how successful the app has become. PayPay is possibly the biggest startup success from Japan. The app which is now 4 years old and does more than just payments and has over 60 Million users which amounts to ⅔ of Japanese Consumers.\nIntroduction #The landscape of financial transactions in Japan, a country once dominated by cash, is undergoing a remarkable transformation. At the heart of this change is the rapid adoption of digital payment systems, challenging the traditional preference for physical currency. Among these emerging technologies, one platform stands out for its groundbreaking impact: PayPay. Launched in 2018, PayPay has not only captured the attention of the Japanese market but has also become a case study in successful digital payment implementation. This blog post delves into the rise of digital payments in Japan, with a special focus on PayPay, exploring its innovative approach and the broader implications for the tech industry.\nHistorical Context of Digital Payments in Japan #Japan’s journey towards digital payments is a narrative of gradual transformation in a country deeply rooted in cash transactions. Traditionally, Japan has been known for its ‘cash is king’ ethos, with a significant portion of the population relying on physical currency for daily transactions. This preference stems from various factors, including the high level of trust in banknotes’ security, the widespread ATM network, and a cultural inclination towards tangible money. However, the landscape began to shift in the 21st century, catalyzed by technological advancements and changing consumer behaviours.\nThe introduction of e-money systems like Suica and Pasmo, initially for transit but later expanded for retail use, marked the beginning of this shift. These systems laid the groundwork for a broader acceptance of non-cash payments. The emergence of smartphones further accelerated this trend, setting the stage for a more dynamic and integrated digital payment ecosystem. Despite this progression, Japan’s digital payment adoption lagged behind other technologically advanced nations, creating an opportunity for a disruptor like PayPay, Line Pay, Rakuten Pay to revolutionize the market.\nRise of PayPay: A Story of Strategic Growth and Massive Backing #PayPay’s journey in Japan’s digital payment space is a striking example of strategic growth fuelled by aggressive marketing and substantial financial backing. The platform, which emerged as a joint venture between SoftBank and Yahoo Japan, was further empowered by the financial muscle of SoftBank’s Vision Fund. This significant cash infusion played a crucial role in PayPay’s aggressive market penetration strategies, particularly its cashback campaigns, which sparked an explosive growth in user adoption.\nIn its initial phase, PayPay made headlines with its bold cashback promotions, offering substantial rebates on purchases made through the platform. This strategy was not just about attracting a large user base but also about altering consumer behavior in a predominantly cash-centric society. The allure of cashback benefits was a masterstroke, effectively incentivizing consumers to switch from traditional cash transactions to digital payments. The campaign’s success was phenomenal, resulting in millions of new users in a remarkably short period, thereby rapidly expanding PayPay’s market share.\nThe backing of SoftBank’s Vision Fund was instrumental in this growth. This support allowed PayPay to sustain its high-cost customer acquisition model, a luxury that many startups could not afford. By leveraging the fund’s resources, PayPay was able to invest heavily in technology development, marketing, and partnerships, quickly becoming a household name in Japan’s digital payment sector.\nTechnological Innovations in PayPay: Paytm’s Influence #PayPay’s technological advancements are not only a product of innovative thinking but also a result of strategic global partnerships, most notably with Paytm, an Indian digital payment giant. This collaboration has played a critical role in shaping PayPay’s technological framework and its subsequent success in the Japanese market.\nLeveraging Paytm’s extensive experience in mobile payments, PayPay has adopted and adapted key technologies and operational strategies that have been successful in India’s highly competitive digital payment space. This includes the QR code-based transaction system, a hallmark of Paytm’s success, which PayPay has effectively localized for the Japanese market. This system’s simplicity and efficiency have been crucial in PayPay’s adoption, especially in catering to a wide range of businesses and consumers.\nFurthermore, Paytm’s influence extends to PayPay’s back-end technology. The platform benefits from Paytm’s robust, scalable, and secure technology infrastructure, which has been battle-tested in a diverse and challenging market like India. This foundation has enabled PayPay to manage a high volume of transactions securely and reliably, a critical factor in gaining consumer trust and ensuring a smooth user experience.\nThe collaboration with Paytm also reflects in PayPay’s approach to user engagement and retention. Borrowing from Paytm’s playbook, PayPay has implemented similar strategies like cashback offers and user-friendly interface designs. These elements have been instrumental in not only attracting first-time users but also in retaining them, fostering a loyal customer base.\nImpact on the Tech Industry, Consumer Behavior, and the Vision Fund #PayPay’s influence in Japan extends beyond the digital payment landscape, having a multi-dimensional impact on the tech industry, consumer behavior, and notably, the Vision Fund’s strategic objectives.\nFor the tech industry, PayPay’s success has been a catalyst, sparking innovation and competition in the fintech sector. This has encouraged other companies to explore and invest in digital payment solutions, thereby enriching the technological ecosystem. The rise of PayPay has demonstrated the viability and potential profitability of fintech ventures in a market traditionally resistant to non-cash transactions. This success story is inspiring a wave of new startups and tech ventures, further driving technological advancement and diversification in Japan.\nOn the consumer front, PayPay has shifted the behavioral paradigm, moving a significant portion of the population from cash to digital payments. This transition, driven by the platform’s convenience and security, is changing the everyday transactional landscape of Japan. Consumers are increasingly expecting seamless digital experiences in their financial transactions, setting a new standard for service and efficiency across various industries.\nThe success of PayPay also aligns with and benefits the strategic goals of the Vision Fund, the key investor behind the platform. The Vision Fund, known for its investments in transformative technologies and innovative startups, has always aimed to identify and support ventures that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries. PayPay’s rapid growth and market penetration in Japan validate the Vision Fund’s investment strategy, showcasing its ability to identify and back winning ideas in competitive, high-growth sectors.\nFurthermore, PayPay’s success story contributes to the Vision Fund’s larger narrative of fostering innovative businesses that lead market shifts. The return on investment and the market influence achieved through PayPay not only bolster the Vision Fund’s portfolio but also enhance its reputation as a visionary investor in the global tech landscape. This success reinforces the fund’s position as a significant player in shaping the future of technology and finance, both in Japan and globally.\nConclusion: PayPay and the Japanese Growth Story #PayPay’s extraordinary ascent in Japan’s digital payment sector is more than a success story of a fintech platform; it’s a testament to the adaptability and growth potential of the Japanese market. This journey reflects a remarkable shift in a society traditionally anchored in cash transactions, signaling a broader openness to technological innovation and digital integration. PayPay’s strategy, leveraging both technological prowess and aggressive marketing, has not only carved out a significant niche for itself but has also spurred a nationwide transformation in payment practices.\nFor technologists and industry observers, PayPay represents a case study in how technological solutions, backed by strong strategic vision and market understanding, can disrupt and redefine established norms. The success of PayPay in Japan, a country known for its stringent standards for technology and service, underscores the potential for digital innovations to make significant inroads in various global markets.\nThis story is also a reminder of the dynamic nature of consumer behavior and market trends. PayPay’s ability to convert a predominantly cash-reliant customer base to digital payment enthusiasts illustrates the power of technology in reshaping habits and expectations. For businesses and technologists, this signifies the importance of staying ahead of the curve in innovation, user experience, and understanding market nuances.\nAs Japan continues to embrace digital transformation, PayPay’s growth narrative stands as a beacon, highlighting the immense possibilities when technology meets consumer needs, backed by strategic execution and a deep understanding of the market’s pulse.\nAppendix:\nhttps://about.paypay.ne.jp/pr/20231025/01/\nhttps://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPay\nhttps://insideout.paypay.ne.jp/en/\n","date":"13 January 2024","permalink":"/blog/003-the-japanese-payment-revolution-and-the-rise-paypay/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"The Japanese Payment Revolution and the Rise Paypay"},{"content":" This story was original published on medium\nUML describing the flow My favorite way of writing an e2e test for my UI is using cypress. Cypress makes things very simple and easy to write tests with.\nThe problem I found with writing tests with cypress is that it takes too long for the test to complete. This in turn creates friction for new developers to do a full-blown e2e test run. Cypress running for 40 mins\nThe fix to ensure we run all our tests regularly to run the test in parallel. Thankfully Jenkins (or any modern CI ) supports running tasks in parallel (https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2017/09/25/declarative-1/).\nstage(\u0026#39;run test\u0026#39;) { parallel { stage(\u0026#39;tester A\u0026#39;) { steps { sh \u0026#34;npm run cy:run:parallel\u0026#34; } } // second tester runs the same command stage(\u0026#39;tester B\u0026#39;) { steps { sh \u0026#34;npm run cy:run:parallel\u0026#34; } } // third tester runs the same command stage(\u0026#39;tester C\u0026#39;) { steps { sh \u0026#34;npm run cy:run:parallel\u0026#34; } } // fourth tester runs the same command stage(\u0026#39;tester D\u0026#39;) { steps { sh \u0026#34;npm run cy:run:parallel\u0026#34; } } } The code above will ensure the tests are run in parallel. Cypress io offers a bunch of plans including a free plan to record the test. The reason why we need to record the test is that cypress takes over the process of dividing the test for each machine.\nAfter doing this change, our tests now run in less than 12mins (from earlier 40mins).\nDue to security concerns, I decided that it’s better to host the dashboard instead of using cypress io. The dashboard will help us run tests in parallel.\nI came across this project Sorry Cypress project which is an open-source alternative to cypress.io paid dashboard. The project was simple to set up since all it involves is running docker-compose up ( Since we are on Kubernetes I had to use kompose to convert docker compose to a helm chart)\nOnce I had it up and running, all I had to do is to change cypress API path to point to the sorry cypress instance Sorry Cypress dashboard Failed Test screenshot\ndef CYPRESS_VERSION=\u0026#34;\\$(npm show cypress version)\u0026#34;def CYPRESS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=\u0026#34;\\$(npx cypress cache path)/${CYPRESS_VERSION}/Cypress/resources/app/packages/server/config/app.yml\u0026#34; sh \u0026#34;sed -i \u0026#39;s/https:\\\\/\\\\/api.cypress.io\\\\//https:\\\\/\\\\/sorry-cy.internal.adityat.com/g\u0026#39; $CYPRESS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH\u0026#34; I used this as step 1 of the Build process, right after I do npm install. This will point cypress instance running on Jenkins to the internally hosted cypress dashboard.\nTo group your tests you can change the CI build command to below, so your test will appear as “master-1”, “master-2”\nsh \u0026#34;npm run cy:run:parallel -- --ci-build-id ${env.BRANCH_NAME}-${env.BUILD_ID}\u0026#34; One thing that may not work with parallelization is the ability to report code coverage.\n","date":"28 November 2021","permalink":"/blog/cypress-jenkins/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Cypress Parallelization on Jenkins using Sorry-Cypress"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
